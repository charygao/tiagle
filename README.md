This repo includes all the [Top Coder](https://www.topcoder.com/) problems I solved while studying for a Google interview.

Further more, some basic data structures are implemented in python (e.g. Hash Table, Binary Tree).

Other type of algorithms are also included (e.g. Binary Search, Sorting Algorithms).
