# Tiagle

This repo includes all the [Top Coder](https://www.topcoder.com/) problems I solved (or tried) while studying for a Google interview.

Further more, some basic data structures are implemented in python (e.g. Hash Table, Binary Tree).

Other type of algorithms are also included (e.g. Binary Search, Sorting Algorithms).

## Important

This notebook is quite big, I strongly recommend exploring it using Jupyter's Collapsible Headings extension. See [nbextensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions) for help.
